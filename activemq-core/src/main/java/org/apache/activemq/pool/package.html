A JMS provider which pools Connection, Session and MessageProducer instances so it can be used with tools like 
Spring's <a href="http://activemq.org/Spring+Support">JmsTemplate</a>. <b>Note</b> that this package
does not deal with pooling of consumers; for that look at a library like <a href="http://jencks.org/">Jencks</a>
such as in <a href="http://jencks.org/Message+Driven+POJOs">this example</a>
