 * A Broker interceptor which updates a JMS Client's timestamp on the message
 * with a broker timestamp.  Useful when the clocks on client machines are known to
 * not be correct and you can only trust the time set on the broker machines.
 * 
 * Enabling this plugin will break JMS compliance since the timestamp that the producer
 * sees on the messages after as send() will be different from the timestamp the consumer
 * will observe when he receives the message.  This plugin is not enabled in the default
 * ActiveMQ configuration.
