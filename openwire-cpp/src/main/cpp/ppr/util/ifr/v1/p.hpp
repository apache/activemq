    /** Base class that enhances the use of the p<> template.
    
       The p<> template is compatible with any type. However, classes that
       derives from refcounted gets the following benefits:

       * It becomes faster to create and assign them to a p<> smart pointer.
       * It becomes faster for the p<> smart pointer to delete them when
         they are no longer references.
       * It becomes possible convert ordinary pointers back to
         p<> smart pointers.
       
       The p<> template inspects it's type to see whether it maintains the
       reference counting mechanism internally or not. By default, the p<>
       template will assume that it's type does not maintain such reference
       counting and will therefore create a container object that performs
       the reference counting. However, if the type is recognized as one
       that can perform reference counting internally, the p<> template
       will use the type's reference counting mechanisms and does not need
       to create a separate reference counting container for the pointer.

       refcounted is an example of a class that handles reference counting
       internally. By deriving from refcounted, your object will contain
       a "built-in" thread-safe reference counter and every time you call
       new() or delete() on your class, only your instance will be created
       or freed instead of also having to create a separate container
       object as well.

       Also have a look at struct Interface, which derives from refcounted
       and is intended to use if your class is subject for multiple
       inheritance.
       
       The internal reference counting gives us another benefit except
       that it does not have to create a container. Since the class has
       a built-in reference counter, it can be converted to a ordinary
       pointer and back again to a smart pointer. Classes that lacks of
       such an internal reference counter lacks the possibility to be
       converted back to a smart pointer from an ordinary pointer.

       Converting an ordinary pointer to a smart pointer should be done
       using the smartify() template function. This function will
       only compile if the given class is recognized as a class with
       it's own internal reference counting mechanism.

       If you already have your own base class or other 3rd party
       base class that has it's own reference counter, you can make
       the p<> template recognize that class in the same way that it
       recognizes refcounted. You can do that without changing
       either the IFR code nor the code of the base class that you
       want to be recognized. What you do is simply to add some
       overloaded versions of the smartptr_xxx() functions and make
       sure that the header file containing these overloaded functions
       are always included everywhere that you use the p<> template
       with that class. To see an example of writing such overloaded
       methods, see how IUnknown is made to recognized by the p<>
       template using it's overloaded versions of the smartptr_xxx()
       functions.

       If your class is intended to be used as one of multiple base classes,
       you must derive virtually from refcounted. Otherwise derived instances
       will result in having ambigous methods and multiple reference counters.

       Normally, multiple inheritance is useful when implementing interfaces.
       It is therefore recommended (for simplicity and clean design) that your
       interfaces derive from Interface rather than from this class directly.
       The struct Interface derives virtually from refcounted for you.

      @see Interface

    class refcounted {
      friend inline void addref (refcounted*);
      friend inline void release (refcounted*);
      friend inline long getrefcount (const refcounted*);
    private:
      atomic refcount_;
    public:
      virtual ~refcounted() {}
    protected:
      virtual void destroy() {
        delete this;
      }
    public:
      inline refcounted(long refcount) : refcount_ (refcount) {}
      inline refcounted() : refcount_ (1) {}
      // When a class derived from refcounted is copied, always reset refcount.
      inline refcounted(const refcounted&) : refcount_ (1) {}
      // When a class derived from refcounted is assigned, don't copy refcount.
      inline refcounted& operator = (const refcounted&) {return *this;}
    };

    /** Base class for interfaces.

      Structs (or classes) that derive from Interface get the following benefits:

        * They (and their children) does not need to define their own virtual
          destructor.
        * They (and their children) can convert their this-pointers to smart
          pointers by calling smartify(this).
        * Smart pointers of these classes or structs become more heap-efficiant.
          (See why in the documentation of refcounted).
      
      These benefits are gained because Interface derives from refcounted
      which has the same benefits. Similar benefits would be gained
      by deriving from IUnknown or any other class that maintains the
      reference counting internally and is adopted to the p<> template
      using the smartptr_xxx () overloaded functions.

      The difference between refcounted and Interface is that Interface is
      more suited for using where multiple inheritance is used. This is due
      to that it derives virtual from refcounted. The virtual derivation
      results in that it can function as base class for any class that is
      intended to be derived from with multiple inheritance, which is a
      typical case when using an interface based design.

      Note that the p<> template does not require it's type to be derived
      from refcounted nor Interface. It's just a help and it gives the
      mentioned benefits.

      The only thing to keep in mind is to never mix classes that derive
      (direct or indirectly) from refcounted and classes that do not derive
      (direct or indirectly) from refcounted in the same class hierarchy.
      Doing so by mistake will be caught by a compilation
      error in the function smartptr_assert_type_compatibility().
