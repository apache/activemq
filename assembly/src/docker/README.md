# Apache ActiveMQ docker

## Installation

Install the most recent stable version of docker
https://docs.docker.com/installation/

Install the most recent stable version of docker-compose
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

If you want to build multi-platform (OS/Arch) Docker images, then you must install
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/).
On macOS, an easy way to install `buildx` is to install [Docker Desktop Edge](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/).

## Build

Images are based on the Docker official [Eclipse Temurin 17 JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin/tags?page=1&name=17-jre) image. If you want to
build the ActiveMQ image you have the following choices:

1. Create the docker image from a local distribution package
2. Create the docker image from an Apache ActiveMQ archive, for example (apache-activemq-6.0.0.tar.gz)
3. Create the docker image from a specific version of Apache ActiveMQ
4. Create the docker image from remote or local custom Apache ActiveMQ distribution

If you run `build.sh` without arguments then you could see how to usage this command.

```bash
Usage:
  build.sh --from-local-dist [--archive <archive>] [--image-name <image>] [--build-multi-platform <comma-separated platforms>]
  build.sh --from-release --activemq-version <x.x.x> [--image-name <image>] [--build-multi-platform <comma-separated platforms>]
  build.sh --help

  If the --image-name flag is not used the built image name will be 'activemq'.
  Check the supported build platforms; you can verify with this command: docker buildx ls
  The supported platforms (OS/Arch) depend on the build's base image, in this case [eclipse-temurin:17-jre](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin).
```

To create the docker image from local distribution) you can execute the command
below. Remember that before you can successfully run this command, you must build
the project (for example with the command `mvn clean install -DskipTests`).

```bash
./build.sh --from-local-dist
```

For create the docker image from the local dist version but with the archive,
you can execute the below command. Remember that before you can successfully run
this command.

```bash
./build.sh --from-local-dist --archive ~/path/to/apache-activemq-6.0.0.tar.gz
```

You can also specify the image name with the `--image-name` flag, for example
(replacing the version, image name, and targets as appropriate):

```bash
./build.sh --from-local-dist --archive ~/Downloads/apache-activemq-6.0.0.tar.gz --image-name myrepo/myamq:x.x.x
```

If you want to build the docker image for a specific version of ActiveMQ
you can run `build.sh` command in this way (replacing the version, image name,
and targets as appropriate):

```bash
./build.sh --from-release --activemq-version 6.0.0 --image-name myrepo/myamq:x.x.x
```

If you want to build the container for a specific version of ActiveMQ and
specific version of the platform, and push the image to the Docker Hub repository,
you can use this command (replacing the version, image name, and targets as appropriate):

```bash
./build.sh --from-release --activemq-version 6.0.0 --image-name myrepo/myamq:x.x.x \
 --build-multi-platform linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7,linux/amd64
```

Below is the output you should get from running the previous command.

```
