    || A simple peer based ActiveMQ Message Broker configuration
    || where brokers are typically embedded in JMS clients and the
    || brokers all auto-discover each other via Zeroconf
    || (which requires multicast to be enabled)
    ||
    || If your network does not support multicast then its advisable
    || to replace this mechansim with hard coded host names
