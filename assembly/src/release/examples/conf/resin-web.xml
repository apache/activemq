      In order to be able to compatiable with Resin 2.1.x and 3.0.x,
      both XML and XSLT have to be replaced.
      If only xalan is included, Resin 2.1.x will fail but not 3.0.x.
      Therefore the best way is to use the compatiable version of the
      XML parser ans XSLT.
       - Please refere to the following link for more detailed information.
