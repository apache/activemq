# Helper script to run the IBM JMS performance harness against
# the ActiveMQ message broker.
#
# Sample Usage: 
#   ./perfharness-activemq.sh -d dynamicQueues/FOO -tc jms.r11.PutGet -nt 6
#
# It assumes that the apache-activemq-${project.version}.jar and 
# perfharness.jar files are in the current directory.  If they are not,
# set the ACTIVEMQ_HOME and PERFHARNESS_HOME env variable to the correct location.
#
# You can download the perfharness.jar file from:
# http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/perfharness
#
# By Default the test connects the the vm://localhost broker.
# To change that, use set the BROKER_URL to the broker url you want to use.
#
