<h1>Getting Started<br>
</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Apache ActiveMQ. This document gives you a quick overview of how to get started trying out Apache ActiveMQ.
</p>

<h2>Running the broker</h2>

<p>
From the binary distribution you can run the Apache ActiveMQ server via the bin/activemq command.
If you're using Windows, just type
</p>
<pre>
    cd bin
    activemq.bat start
</pre>
<p>
On Unix-like systems, type
</p>
<pre>
    ./bin/activemq console
</pre>
<p>to start the broker in foreground.</p>
<p>
The Apache ActiveMQ broker should now have started
</p>
<p>
Tip: If you run the bin/activemq command without any arguments it will output usage.
</p>

To stop the broker you can press ctrl + c to stop the process.

<h2>Running the broker in the background</h2>

<p>
The broker can be started as a background process via the bin/activemq command
on Unix-like systems, type
</p>
<pre>
    ./bin/activemq start
</pre>
<p>to start the broker in background. The broker will write to its log in the data/activemq.log file.</p>

<h2>Stopping the broker</h2>

<p>
The broker can be stopped via the bin/activemq command
If you're using Windows, just type
</p>
<pre>
    cd bin
    activemq.bat stop
</pre>
<p>
On Unix-like systems, type
</p>
<pre>
    ./bin/activemq stop
</pre>
<p>to stop the broker.


<h2>Access the web console</h2>

In a web browser you can access the url <a href="http://0.0.0.0:8161/admin">http://0.0.0.0:8161/admin</a> to access the ActiveMQ web console.
<br/>
The broker may ask for credentials to login the web console the first time.
The default username and password is admin/admin. You can configure this in the conf/jetty-real.properties file.

<h2>Access the web demos</h2>

You would need to start the broker with the demos included, which you do as follows:
If you're using Windows, just type
</p>
<pre>
    cd bin
    activemq.bat console xbean:examples/conf/activemq-demo.xml
</pre>
<p>
On Unix-like systems, type
</p>
<pre>
    ./bin/activemq console xbean:examples/conf/activemq-demo.xml
</pre>

In a web browser you can access the url <a href="http://0.0.0.0:8161/demo">http://0.0.0.0:8161/demo</a> to access the ActiveMQ web demos.
<br/>
The broker may ask for credentials to login the web console the first time.
The default username and password is admin/admin. You can configure this in the conf/jetty-real.properties file.


<h2>Running the example programs</h2>

<p>
To run the demo producer/consumer tools, you need Java and Ant installed.
</p>

<h3>Installing Ant</h3>


<p>
The example programs depend on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> being installed. There are more detailed
instructions on the Ant website - but essentially you need to follow these steps.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
JAVA_HOME must point to your JDK installation, such that $JAVA_HOME/bin contains the java executable and $JAVA_HOME/lib contains some jar files.
</li>
<li>
ANT_HOME must point to where you installed Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
</li>
<li>
then you need to add $JAVA_HOME/bin and $ANT_HOME/bin to your PATH variable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To test this is all working, try typing
</p>

<pre>
    java -version
    cd examples/openwire/swissarmy
    ant -version
</pre>

<h3>Running the example producer and consumer</h3>

<p>
Once you've got Java and Ant installed correctly you should be able to run
</p>

<pre>
    cd examples/openwire/swissarmy
    ant consumer
</pre>

<p>
and in another shell
</p>

<pre>
    cd examples/openwire/swissarmy
    ant producer
</pre>

<p>
you can specify exact URLs to connect to via command like arguments. e.g.
</p>

<pre>
    ant producer -Durl=tcp://somehost:port
</pre>
