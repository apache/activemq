Welcome to Apache ActiveMQ 
=================== 
Apache ActiveMQ is a high performance Apache 2.0 licenced Message Broker and JMS 1.1 implementation.


Incubation Disclaimer
=====================
Apache ActiveMQ is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Geronimo PMC. 

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does 
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
