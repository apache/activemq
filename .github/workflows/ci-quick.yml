# This is our most used build and the one used when a new PR is created/updated. It needs to
# be and remain as green as possible. It is also executed when a PR is actually merged to make sure
# apache/main stays stable. It runs a subset of the tests (the ones in the quick profile) to make sure it finishes
# in a reasonable time.
