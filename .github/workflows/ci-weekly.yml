# This build runs manually for now. It takes a very long time to run, so until we can
# work on the stability to make it scheduled weekly, we'd better run it manually.
# The build does the same as ci-quickly.yaml but runs all the possible tests
# (as opposed to quick profile only for the other one running on PR/Merge)
