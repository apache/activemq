<p>
	ActiveCluster API for working with a simple cluster abstraction for building cluster algorithms
	like buddy systems, voting, master/slave protocols, electing a controller and so forth.
</p>
	Clusters communicate across a common destination (typically a Topic) but every member (node)of a 
	cluster has a unique name (the generation of unique names is left to the developer), and a
	unique destination (which uses the unique name).
