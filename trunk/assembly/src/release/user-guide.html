<h1>Getting Started<br>
</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Apache ActiveMQ. This document gives you a quick overview of how to get started trying out Apache ActiveMQ.
</p>

<h2>Running the broker</h2>

<p>
From the binary distribution you can run the Apache ActiveMQ server pretty easily via the bin/activemq command.
If you're using Windows, just type
</p>
<pre>
    cd bin
    activemq
</pre>
<p>
On Unix-like systems, type
</p>
<pre>
    cd bin
    activemq console
</pre>
<p>to start the broker in foreground.</p>
<p>
The Apache ActiveMQ broker should now have started
</p>

<h2>Running the example programs</h2>

<p>
To run the demo producer/consumer tools, you need Java and Ant installed.
</p>

<h3>Installing Ant</h3>


<p>
The example programs depend on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> being installed. There are more detailed
instructions on the Ant website - but essentially you need to follow these steps.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
JAVA_HOME must point to your JDK installation, such that $JAVA_HOME/bin contains the java executable and $JAVA_HOME/lib contains some jar files.
</li>
<li>
ANT_HOME must point to where you installed Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
</li>
<li>
then you need to add $JAVA_HOME/bin and $ANT_HOME/bin to your PATH variable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To test this is all working, try typing
</p>

<pre>
    java -version
    cd example
    ant -version
</pre>

<h3>Running the example producer and consumer</h3>

<p>
Once you've got Java and Ant installed correctly you should be able to run
</p>

<pre>
    cd example
    ant consumer
</pre>

<p>
and in another shell
</p>

<pre>
    cd example
    ant producer
</pre>

<p>
you can specify exact URLs to connect to via command like arguments. e.g.
</p>

<pre>
    ant producer -Durl=tcp://somehost:port
</pre>
